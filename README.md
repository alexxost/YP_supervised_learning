## Goals of the assignment

Development of the prediction model for the bank. 

*Purpose*: Estimation of the client loss. 

*Key problem*: Heavily inbalanced data-set. 

## Solution

For the model a classic Random Forest was chosen. Selected metrics were F1 and ROC-AUC. Disbalance was neutralized by the upscaling strategy. Profile of the leaving client was formed. 

## Additional studies

It was investigated how efficient the model would be with a drastic reduction of a data-set size and which approaches may help to work with a lack of real data.
